# Documentation on python scripts

following packages must be installed via pip:

pip install <packageName>

- sklearn
- imageio

The python scripts require the folder/ file of the profiles and calibrations that need to be plotted. Selecting the granularity / scale, currently has to be done manually in the scripts itself.
